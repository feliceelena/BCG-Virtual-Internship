# BCG Virtual Internship by Forage

This is not an official internship program by Boston Consulting Group (BCG). This virtual internship will allow data scientist to focused on modeling data to be able to accurately predict an outcome, for example, predicting how likely customers are to leave (churn). 

Brief introduction to our business case:
- Your client is **PowerCo** - a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to small and medium sized enterprises.
- The energy market has had a lot of **change** in recent years and there are more options than ever for customers to choose from.
- PowerCo are concerned about their **customers leaving for better offers** from other energy providers. When a customer leaves to use another service provider, this is called **churn**.
- This is becoming a big issue for PowerCo and they have engaged BCG to help **diagnose the reason why their customers are churning**.
- We have discussed some **potential reasons** for this churn, one being how **“sensitive” the price is**. In other words, how much is price a factor in a customer’s choice to stay with or leave PowerCo?

## Task 1: Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing
- Understand PowerCo's problem in detail.
- Outline an email discussing the data that we'll need from the client and the techniques we'll use to investigate the issue.

## Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
- Investigate whether price sensitivity is the most influential factor for a customer churning, and if not, to what extent does price sensitivity influence churn.
- Perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using three datasets (historical customer data, historical pricing data, churn indicator).
- Analyze the data types of each column, distributions of the columns, and perform a descriptive statistics.
- Dataset: “client_data.csv” and “price_data.csv”

## Task 3: Feature Engineering & Modelling
- Perform an feature engineering to improve machine learning model training, leading to better performance and greater accuracy.
- Follow a framework of either removing features, creating new feature using existing columns, or combining columns.
- Dataset: “clean_data_after_eda.csv”

## Task 4: Findings & Recommendations
- Build and train a predictive model using Random Forest classifier to predict a customer churning.
- Evaluate the predictions using evaluation metrics to demonstrate how accurately the model has performed.
- Dataset: “data_for_predictions.csv”
- Create a PowerPoint slide to summarize our insights.
